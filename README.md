Obstacle Game

Description: for my final project, I am creating an obstacle game in which the player is on the left of the screen and obstacles are placed randomly on the right of the screen and travel to the left as if the player on the left is moving to the right. The user can control the player's vertical position using a potentiometer and tries to avoid hitting the obstacles. 

Input hardware: SSD1306 OLED screen, ATTiny416 Xplained, potentiometer.
